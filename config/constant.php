    | These values must be set in the .env file as string as following:
    | BOOKING_LOCATION; array; vaccination site names 
    | BOOKING_VACCINE; multidimensional array; with each nested array representing
    |   a vaccine with the first entry being the vaccine name and second entry 
    |   specifying availability denoted in boolean of True or False. The remaining entries
    |   represent the availabilty of doses. For example, if there is only the second dose
    |   available for AstraZeneca then the only remaining entry would be an int of number 2.
    |   However, if there there are three doses but and all of them would be availabe the 
    |   remaining ints after the second entry would be 1, 2, 3
    | 
    | All of the above can be can be ignored if the below defaults suffice
